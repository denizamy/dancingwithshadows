Icons: Crafts Tools Foraging

Richly detailed, hand-painted icons suitable for a strategy game, RPG, or boardgame-like experience. This is a rather varied set of crafting tools, crafted products, and natural products like herbs, berries, mushrooms, hides, feathers, furs, ashes, oil, and bones. Because hey, maybe you need a bunch of random stuff?

- 118 icons (so far! more are added with updates)
- all icons are 128x128 pixels
- icons work on black, white, or transparent background
- includes raw materials: animal, vegetable, mineral, and fungal
- includes various hand-tools, intermediate crafting products, and some finished goods

Icons are provided as individual transparent-background PNG files. 

Feel free to email me and suggest more icons if you have any ideas.
