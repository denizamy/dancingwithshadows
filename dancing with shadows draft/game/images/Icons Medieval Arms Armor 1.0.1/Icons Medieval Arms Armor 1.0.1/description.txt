Richly detailed, hand-painted icons suitable for a strategy game, RPG, or boardgame-like experience.

- 93 icons (so far!)
- all icons are 128x128 pixels
- provided on a transparent background
- icons are provided as individual PNG files

This icon set is made up of medieval weapons and armor which are more-or-less realistic and inspired by historical designs. Mostly. As I expand the set, it'll probably branch out into more medieval-fantasy directions, though with a generally grounded aesthetic.

Feel free to email me and suggest more icons if you have any ideas! I have a few ideas myself, and have plans to create icon sets for other themes & genres.

Do you want these icons in larger sizes? Do a quick search for an algorithmic image upscaler and use one of them tuned for 2D art- the results are really nice.
